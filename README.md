## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
With  the help of front-end mentor, I put some of what I learned on freecodecamp tutorials to work. I was able to work on my decision making such as choosing grid over flexbox in this project, Hone my html mark up skills and take solace in the fact that I can get better with practice.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since I still have some issues with writing,planning and organizing my workflow, I've been checking for some articles to help me with that.
If you want more help with writing markdown,I'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Now that I understand CSS grid and how valuable it is for responsive design, I think I  might stick to it rather than using flexbox.

### Useful resources

- [CSS tricks](https://www.css-tricks.com) - This helped me with the swapping out images based on the device width. I really liked their documentation and will use it going forward.
- [MDN Mozilla web resources](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand grid template areas. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
